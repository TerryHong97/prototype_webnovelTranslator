Until just a moment ago, Cyan had been gaping in shock. Now, his face contorted with anger. It was a long-standing tradition of the Lionheart family that children of the Branch Family were not to train mana before the Bloodline Ceremony. Only the children of the Main Family were allowed to train mana and wield real weapons from an early age.

The tradition had been trampled before his eyes. This was no longer a matter that could be dismissed with mere spite and tantrums.

“I didn’t train,” Eugene answered nonchalantly. His expression was indifferent. It wasn’t a lie. Although he could have started mana training from the moment he could crawl, he hadn’t. He didn't want to trouble his father, Jehad, and since he had been reincarnated as Vermouth’s descendant, he had a desire to try Vermouth's mana training method.

“You're obviously lying...! How can you handle that weight without mana training?!”

“Since I was seven, I could manage.”

“Don’t lie!”

“Why do you keep saying it's a lie when you haven't even tried it yourself? If you doubt it so much, why not confirm it with a duel?”

Eugene sat down and untied the sandbags from the spear. Cyan, who had been watching with wide eyes, felt his younger sister Nina's expectant gaze. He also sensed the fearful looks from the servants in the annex who were peering curiously through the windows of the Training Hall.

It was Cyan who first spoke of a duel. It was also Cyan who took out the handkerchief and, despite Eugene's reluctance, insisted on honor. He couldn’t back down now, especially with the added sin of training mana before the Bloodline Ceremony as a Branch Family member.

He had to punish him. If he backed down here, his younger sister would tease him not just for a few days but for his entire life. Resolutely, Cyan picked up a wooden sword that was lying around. It was the one Eugene had been swinging earlier.

“...It’s a duel!”

Cyan shouted as he threw the handkerchief at Eugene. It landed on Eugene's shoulder just as he finished untying the last sandbag from the spear.

“I accept.”

Eugene nodded and stood up.

Cyan was excited about his first-ever duel. His heart pounded with excitement just before and after throwing the handkerchief. He thought about how to punish the arrogant one who had disregarded the family tradition. How could he make his sister admire his prowess?

Those thoughts were abruptly cut off.

As Eugene stood up, he thrust the spear.

Cyan, who had been stepping back while conscious of the wooden sword in his right hand, couldn’t react properly to the spear's movement.

Thwack! The spear’s tip hit Cyan's abdomen hard.

“Ugh!”

Cyan let out a scream and rolled on the ground.
